midflip.com

midflip.com is Shu Yeung's online photography portfolio.

The aim is to provide viewers with a consistent, clean layout across mobile and desktop platforms which allow the photos to speak for themselves.

The site is built using Bootstrap 3 from a mobile first approach.

The site features a responsive CSS only slider developed for Bootstrap3.

DRY CSS concepts were used in stylesheet design to compliment Bootstrap's SMACSS approach.
