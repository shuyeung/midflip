Learning, seeing and shooting underwater rugby for the first time was an amazing challenge that pushed me technically, physically and intellectually. It was a difficult task capturing the scale, dynmamics and gameplay of the sport in a single frame but I felt this frame did a good job</span>

The city's architecture and bustling life made it difficult to seek out stories. This frame came from a lot of exploring and looking up. It is a portrait of Hong Kong that people don't often see and hinted at private lives tucked away in the concrete towers that dominate the city</span>

Her passion for teaching and raising public awareness for multiple sclerosis and euthanasia was  very impressionable. I spent a few mornings with her and her carer Yasutaka, observing and photographing her exhaustive daily routine: things she needed help for; things we all take for granted. Loredana spends most of her days restricted to her apartment: the story of her daily needs hidden from view and public understanding. I chose this frame to bring these important issues forward</span>

David's drag name 'Davina' was a name coined from a childhood taunt. During the photo shoot, David told me how he discovered the drag community and how participating in it gave him the confidence to accept and speak up about his sexuality</span>

The bikie community wasn't one I had ever thought I'd find myself photographing, but four hours out of Sydney, I found myself in the middle of a burn out competition. The charity ride was held in memory of the late Dale Freeman, a photographer for 'Live To Ride' magazine who committed suicide in 2011. Funds raised at the two day event were donated to BlackDog Rides, an organisation rallying the support of motorcycle riders across Australia for mental health services and raising awareness for mental health issues</span>

        <p class="padding-left-2px">Shu was named The Sydney Mornng Herald's 2014 Clique Photographer of the Year for his six frame portfolio.</p>
        <p>Clique is a photographic association that ran monthly competitions based on ten photographic briefs. The Clique Photographer of the Year was awarded to the photographer with the strongest portfolio consisting of six to ten photos submitted in response to each brief.</p>
        <p>"I chose six photos I felt provided the most insight, used the whole frame to tell a story and compelled the viewer to look and look again. I've found myself drawn to detail-rich scenes this year and I think a big part of this was being only allowed to submit single frames for each brief."</p>
        <p>"I heard that the average person spends one second on a photo they like on Instagram - which was pretty shocking because if I like an image, I usually take time to explore it. My response was to look for scenes, compositions and moments that had the potential to live for more than a second."</p>
